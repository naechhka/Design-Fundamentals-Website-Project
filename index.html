                    <p>HI! I’m Anastasiia, though friends just call me Nastya, originally from Ukraine by the way. 
                        At 19, I stepped into my first year Digital media at UWE. Funny enough, once I said, 
                        "I will never do websites again in my life”, but now here I am, presenting my website for
                        Graphic & Web design studio, and I actually enjoy it.</p>

                <h1>Reflection</h1>
                <p>I began my journey at UWE in 2023 with a foundation year. During that time, I struggled with a module that was quite similar to Graphic & Web Design Studio. 
                    However, the first assignment that we have on GWDS seemed more achievable than on foundation year. To approach this assignment, I divided the whole project
                    into five components: worksheets, CARP task, typography, web building and writing.
                    <br></br>
                    Firstly, I started from worksheets, and they were not that complicated like I thought before. With prior experience in web building, I found coding sheets useful
                    to refresh my skills in HTML and CSS again. As concerns GitHub, I had often heard about it but had not used it before this module and it turned out to be a free way 
                    to host static websites using repositories. 
                    <br></br>
                    Then, almost at the same time with worksheets I initiated to do my CARP posters which were difficult in the beginning because of lack of knowledge in InDesign. 
                    However, after several attempts to do first poster I gained confidence. Then I faced the problem, that I did not find inspiration every time I tried to do posters 
                    for True/False film festival, I forced myself to do it at the time when I needed to, but that was ineffective. Therefore, when ideas came to my mind, I started to 
                    implement them immediately. All posters were going to be completely different, and I achieved that. 
                    <br></br>
                    As regards typography task, I completed it faster than posters, although, I did not have experience in Illustrator, acquired skills in InDesign helped to understand 
                    how this software works. To be honest, I have done all 8 types at one day but then changed them multiple times because they did not fit my webpage.   
                    <br></br>
                    The most significant and important part was building of the web site on which I spent more time than on other sections.  Firstly, I started from creating design for my web pages,
                    I have couple of hand-drawn sketches just for a layout and some on my tablet where I was doing more detailed. Equally important is colour pallete, which I was choosing for almost 
                    whole day and changed it for about 30 times. As a basis, I stopped at three main colours: navy blue, a shade of red and milky colour. The final website closely matches my vision, 
                    however, there is one aspect which I do not like about my web pages is how certain pages look on different screen sizes.  
                    <br></br>
                    Final task was to complete writing part. During web building process I used Lorem Ipsum to visualise, how each page looks with content on it. Once coding was finished, I replaced Lorem Ipsum with required content. 
                    In conclusion, I am pleased with the work I have accomplished although it has some imperfections. This assignment improved my skills in web building and graphic design, and I am looking forward for next project.

                <h2>Contrast</h2>
                <p>My first design poster for True/False festival primarily relies on contrast principle. 
                    According to my concept, there are several main points of emphasis on this poster which 
                    clearly demonstrate contrast. For instance, black film roll creates difference between itself, 
                    light yellow background and light grey map of America. Black roll, in turn, contrasts with
                    the text. Content on the roll has difference in size which help to attract attention and 
                    emphasises that it is a film festival. Additionally, text uses colour contrast highlight 
                    the most important information, further enhancing the overall effect.</p>
            </div>  

            <div class="box box-text-carp box3-carp">
                <h2>Repetition</h2>
                <p>Second poster uses slightly different colour pallet compared to previous one. The main colours 
                   here will be black, red which is the same with red with logo, shadows of the red, white. To 
                   demonstrate repetition principle, I repeatedly used the festival name, “True/False”, which quickly
                   captures attention. The colours repetition, in turn, allowed adhere to main concept Additionally,
                   the poster applies another design principle: contrast.  This can be seen in the background, which 
                   is divided diagonally, with one side red and the other black.</p>

            <div class="box box-text-carp box6-carp">
                <h2>Alignment</h2>
                <p>This poster is based on alignment principle, where I decided to locate text in the centre to create 
                   a sense of order and harmony. Film strip, for its part, is also vertically cantered.  </p> </div>
            <div class="box box-text-carp box7-carp">
                <h2>Proxomity</h2>
                <p>The final poster, which I found the most challenging to implement because the main idea was
                   to place the text in the shape of camera, and it seemed hard to do. This design illustrates 
                   the proximity principle by grouping related elements together. I divided content into 
                   four groups: title, main paragraph, navigation information and logo. By carefully organizing
                   these elements, I achieved a composition that visually mimics a camera when viewed as a whole.
                   In addition, poster demonstrates elements of contrast principle by using white text 
                   colour and black background. </p>
